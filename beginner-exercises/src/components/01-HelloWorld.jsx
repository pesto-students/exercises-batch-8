import React from 'react';

// Task: Render "Hello World" text.
// All components *must* have a `render` method defined.

// To define a component's render method, we use syntax called JSX. As you
// can see it looks similar to HTML. JSX gets converted to
// JavaScript code. It is here just for readability purposes.
const HelloWorld = () => <h1>Hello World</h1>;

export default HelloWorld;
